This script collection automatize **Openbox** installation and essentials tools and apply my personal configurations, styles and themes. Althoughs is a collection of my particular configs may be interesting for someone.
 
Each action script and dependences are in a directory. There are 4 scripts categories:
  * **install scripts**: install packages or download some installer and install those
  * **config scripts**: apply some configurations in system.
  * **theme scripts**: copy themes, icons, or apply some graphical configs
  * **script scripts**: install some script. 

The main script `install` can exec all scripts or only a select list:
  * `install -l`: list all scripts.
  * `install`: exec all scripts interactively asking for each one if install or not.
  * `install -d`: install all default scripts.
  * `install -a 5,8-12`: install selected scripts.
